#  A private conversation

```
Last week I went to the theatre.

I had a very good seat. 

The play was very interesting.

 I did not enjoy it. 

A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. 

They were talking loudly. 

I got very angry. 

I could not hear the actors. 

I turned round. 

I looked at the man and the woman angrily.

 They did not pay any attention.

 In the end, I could not bear it. 

I turned round again. 

'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.

'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. 'This is a private conversation!'
