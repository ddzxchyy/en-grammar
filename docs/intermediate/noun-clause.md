# 名词从句

名词从句是复句的从属从句, 名词从句必须放在主句的名词位置(主语,宾语,补语,同位语),当做名词使用



## 主语位置

* Something is strange.

* He didn't show up on time.

* It is strange that he didn't show up on time.

从句过长,可以用虚词it充当形式主语,让主句清楚地表达出来



* Where is he hiding now.

* The question is a big mystery.

* It is a big mystery where he is hiding now


疑问语序改成陈述语序


## 动词的宾语位置

* The defendant said (that) he didn't do it.

名词从句放在**及物动词**后面的宾语位置可以清晰地看出这是名词从句,可以省略that.



## 补语位置

* The important thing is (that) we're all right.



## 同位语位置

* The woman can’t forget the fact (that) her husband cheated on her.



### 不明显的同位语

* I am afraid (of that thing) that I can't help you.

* The student is worried (about the possibility) (that) he may fail in the exam.

* The family was unaware(of the fact) (that) a burglar had broken into the cellar.


I am afraid当中看不出有任何位置可以放这个名词从句,是因为省略了of that thing.



## 介词的宾语位置

* My response depends on the question.

* What did he really mean by that?

* My response depends **on** what he really meant by that.




* His response dwells on the fact.

* I owe him a favor.

* His response dwells on the fact (that) I owe him a favor.

**因为that从句不能接在介词后面当宾语, 所以必须放在另外一个位置, 这里当the fact 的同位语**



## 名词从句的放大(评论从句)

 名词从句的内容有时候比主句重要,这时候可以选择把把名词从句当做主句处理, 反而把主句缩小,移到不重要的位置

* This is your last offer, I suppose.

* I suppose that this is your last offer



## whether和if

* I can't tell which.

* Either he's telling the truth or he's not.

* I can't tell whether(if) he's telling the truth or not.



* Either the stock market will improve or it will not.
* (The question) which is impossible to say now.

*  Whether the stock market will improve or not is impossible to say now.

句首的时候不能用if, 因为if有如果的意思

* Either the tumor is malignant or it is not.
* The treatment will be decided  by (the question) which.

* The treatment will be decided  by whether the tumor is malignant or not.

**whether可以放在介词后面,因为它是which和either合成的词, which是代名词,可以作介词的宾语.**
